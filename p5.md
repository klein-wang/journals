#### Abstract

> Forecast of football outcomes in terms of Home Win, Draw and Away Win (HDA) relies largely on ex ante probability elicitation of these events and ex post verification of them via computation of probability scoring rules (Brier, Ranked Probability, Logarithmic, Zero-One scores). Usually, appraisal of the quality of forecasting procedures is restricted to reporting mean score values. The purpose of this article is to propose additional tools of verification, such as score decompositions into several components of special interest. Graphical and numerical diagnoses of reliability and discrimination and kindred statistical methods are presented using different techniques of binning (fixed thresholds, quantiles, logistic and iso regression). These procedures are illustrated on probability forecasts for the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League (C1) at the end of the group stage based on typical Poisson regression models with reasonably good results in terms of reliability as compared to those obtained from bookmaker odds and whatever the technique used. Links with research in machine learning and different areas of application (meteorology, medicine) are discussed.

#### Introduction

In the article, the author is considering outcome variables as HAD (Home Win, Away Win, Draw) categorical results, in terms of scorelines {Y(A), Y(B)} goals in match (A vs B) i.e., pairs of integers. Traditionally in football, one summarizes HDA forecast performance by a synthetic criterion such as the mean square error known as Brierâ€™s score (1950). To review the deficiencies of issued forecasts, analytical attributes of Brier's score can be brought out such as Reliability, Resolution, Discrimination, Refinement and etc. 

#### Parameterization: Decomposition of the Brier score

Let X be the binary outcome of the event H with probability and P the random variable probabilistic forecast of X taking values p. The Half-Brier score defined as the loss function ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=S%28P%2CX%29%3D%28P-X%29%5E2) . Using the conditioning rule, the Murphy (1973, Calibration-Refinement factorization) decomposition of its expectation can be written as:

![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5BS%28P%2CX%29%5D%3DVar%28X%29-Var_P+%5B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_X%28X%7CP%29%5D%2B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_P%7B%5B%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_X%28X%7CP%29-P%5D%5E2%7D)

, where three terms are respectively representing Uncertainty (UNC), Resolution (RES) and Reliability (REL). 

- UNC measures the variance of the outcome that is out of control of the forecaster,
- RES measures the variability between the conditional expectations of the observed outcomes given their forecasts (i.e. the ability of forecast to distinguish situations with distinctly different frequencies of occurrence),
- REL measures the average squared differences between the conditional expectation of the outcome and its forecast.

A second factorization method (Likelihood-base) is also discussed which includes a Refinement (REF), Discrimination (DIS) term. 

#### Methodology & Analysis

A logistic model of the probability of Homewin, Draw and Awaywin (HDA) was fitted on the logit of its probabilistic forecast under a Poisson regression model (POI).

Following Cox (1958), the model relating X to P is written via a logit linear predictor: ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=logit%5BPr%28X_i%3D1%29%5D%3D%5Calpha%2B%5Cbeta+%5Ctimes+logit%28p_i%29) with i) ( ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Calpha%3E0+%5Cmbox%7B+and+%7D+%5Cbeta%3D1) ) for concave under-forecasting profiles; and ii) ( ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Calpha%3C0+%5Cmbox%7B+and+%7D+%5Cbeta%3D1) ) for convex over-forecasting profiles. 

From the Reliability Diagrams for Home Win Probability Forecasts, results were shown that the forecasts were reliable with 95% Consistency Bands.

The article has further discussed verifications on Likelihood-base and Yates' decompositions of Brier's score. Regarding its application to the UEFA Champions League, it turns out that forecasts of Away Wins is both well calibrated and refined with good discrimination properties. The same trend can be seen on Home Wins, but with a trade-off between that over-forecasted category and under-forecasted draws with little discrimination of draw forecasts.
