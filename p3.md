#### Abstract

> The goal of credit scoring models is to predict the creditworthiness of a customer and determine whether they will be able to meet a given financial obligation or default on it. Such models allow a financial institution to minimize the risk of loss by setting decision rules regarding which customers receive loan and credit card approvals. Logistic regression can be used to predict default events and model the influence of different variables on a consumer's creditworthiness. In this paper we use a logistic regression model to predict the creditworthiness of bank customers using predictors related to their personal status and financial history. Model adequacy and robustness checks are performed to ensure that the model is being properly fitted and interpreted.

#### Dataset

The data set used is the German Credit dataset obtained from the UCI machine-learning data archive and includes 20 covariates (7 numerical, 13 categorical) and 1000 observations. Each observation represents an individual customer with the response indicating their actual classification (1 = "Good" or 0 = "Bad"). 

For the purpose of this paper, 5 major predictors have been selected to build on the logistic model. The predictors cover financial, living and social indicators.

#### Introduction & Modelling

In this paper, a binary logistic model is fitted to the data, using the logit link function. In other words, the classification of the ![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=i_%7Bth%7D) customer as having good or bad creditability is modeled using a Bernoulli random variable:

![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=Y_i%3D%5Cleft%5C%7B+%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+1+%26+%2C+%26+%5Cmbox%7Bif+the+customer+is+creditworthy%7D+%5C%5C+0+%26+%2C+%26+%5Cmbox%7Botherwise%7D+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D+%5Cright.)

with conditional probabilities ![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=P%28Y_i%3D1%7Cx_i%29%3D%5Cpi_i) and ![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=P%28Y_i%3D0%7Cx_i%29%3D1-%5Cpi_i). 

The conditional expectation is the given by: ![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=E%28Y_i%7Cx_i%29%3DP%28Y_i%3D1%7Cx_i%29%5Ctimes+1%2BP%28Y_i%3D0%7Cx_i%29%5Ctimes+0%3D%5Cpi_i) . 

The link function is essentially transferring the predicted probability into a more interpretable indicator which in this case is odds ratio: 

logit ![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Cpi_i%3D%5Clog%28%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi_i%7D%7B1-%5Cpi_i%7D%29%3Dx_i%5E%7B%27%7D%5Cbeta%3D%5Ceta_i)

The estimation is performed by iterative weighted least squares (IWLS). 

#### Model Adequacy

In terms of model validation, the author first tested on the significance of the deviance reduction, which suggest weak evidence against the model/link given large p-value. Since the Pearson chi-square statistic or the deviance likelihood ratio test are not informative, Hosmer Lemeshow Test was performed to further compare the test statistic of observations in g categories to a ![[公式]](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Cchi%5E2_%7Bg-2%7D) distribution. Similar result was given.

#### Outlier detection

In this paper, Cook's Distance was used to plot the observations and identified three outliers in the data set. Comparing original model with a second model by removing those three cases to study their impact on the estimation and conclusions, the author has found that removal of those cases does not lead to noticeable changes in estimated parameters. 

#### Robustness Checks

An alternative model is fit using aggregated data, to see if the conclusions of these models agree with those of the original model. By grouping the covariate data prior to aggregation, a smaller range of covariate patterns (i.e. collinearity) would be achieved. In particular, the categories of 4 factor variables have been more general, including history, duration, marital status and purpose. Based on Likelihood ratio test, the results agree with those of the original model. The exceptions are that when gender and status are considered separately, they are not significant variables, and purpose is also insignificant at 95% significance level.

#### Conclusion

The main findings of statistical analysis are as follows:

- Odds of a consumer's creditworthiness increase with an increase in the size of their checking account.
- Odds of a consumer's creditworthiness is 1.636 times greater when he is a single male than who being divorced/married females. 
- Odds of a consumer's creditworthiness with a purpose of car is likely to be the greatest.
- Increased duration decreases the odds of creditworthiness.
- Consumers with "critical" credit history show large increases in expected odds of creditworthiness. In other words, the result suggests that consumers with worse credit history are less likely to default. It is very important that author has given out two possible explanations:

1. The bank may be more stringent when it comes to loaning a consumer with bad credit history, whereas consumers with good credit history do not face the same kind of scrutiny and may end up being issued a loan they eventually cannot repay.
2. An alternative explanation is that there may be a data issue in which the categories were incorrectly labeled. It would be best to be cautious with the interpretation of this result.
