## Abstract

> Common compartmental modeling for COVID-19 is based on a priori knowledge and numerous assumptions. Additionally, they do not systematically incorporate asymptomatic cases. Our study aimed at providing a framework for data-driven approaches, by leveraging the strengths of the grey-box system theory or grey-box identification, known for its robustness in problem solving under partial, incomplete, or uncertain data. 
> The model was implemented and solved using an Ordinary Differential Equation solver and an optimization tool. A cross-validation technique was applied, and the coefficient of determination R2 was computed in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. Key epidemiological parameters were finally estimated and we provided the rationale for the construction of SEAIRD model. 

## **Introduction**

A traditional modeling approach in epidemiology for infectious diseases is to use compartment modeling which relies on the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered or Removed)-type models, coupled with ARIMA model, deep learning. But the model suffers a number of issues, including the priori assumptions, and the need of a thorough knowledge of the circulating virus, which was difficult at the moment of conducting this study, due to the novelty SARS-CoV-2. 

In order to compensate the dearth of data and uncertainties around SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of action and that of its related disease, the COVID-19, authors postulate that the grey-box system identification theory (GBSIT) could make an asset to tackle these challenges. 

Mathematically, the COVID-19 dynamic model can be seen as a switching system with non-linear system models, where the switches are triggered by control measures set by authorities. The switching model coupled with grey-box approach provides flexibility in characterizing the dynamics of the epidemic across its different phases. One major advantage of such data-driven approach is its ability to operate under limited priori knowledge of the studied phenomenon. 

## **Dataset**

The epidemiologic data were taken from an open source repository operated by the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC). The database provides daily number of new cases and deaths for different countries.

All used epidemiologic data were taken from an [https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19) pandemic open source repository operated by the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC).

In order to preclude perturbations to the modeling approach due to changes in behaviors, as a consequence of policy measures taken by countries, only data on the dynamical stable phase of the epidemic is considered, i.e. a period within the setting of control measures.

## **Methodology**

The model in this paper has considered human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 strain, with the following assumptions (provided t is the time stamp): 

- Infective persons can be classified in two categories; one of which is with symptoms, denoted by I(t), and the other is without any clinical presence of symptoms called asymptomatic or subclinical infective cases, denoted by A(t).
- When a change in the behavior of people occurs due to a public response to the outbreak, the contact rate (reflecting the level of risky behaviors) decreases with the increase in the cumulative numbers of removed persons;
- Homogeneous mixing population is assumed.

The proposed SEAIRD model is a compartment model that explicitly incorporates asymptomatic cases in the analysis of the epidemic evolution. The model consists of the following time-dependent variables: S(t): susceptible individuals; E(t): exposed (incubating) population; A(t): asymptomatic infective people; I(t): symptomatic infective individuals; R(t): removed persons (i.e. completely and/or temporary recovered from COVID-19); D(t): Dead people. A flow chart of the model is given above.

Relevant parameters are defined as follows:

Here, both cumulative infective cases and dead cases are discretized with a sampling period of one day to reduce the computation costs, yielding: ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Cmathscr%7BI%7D%28t%29%3D%5Csum_%7Bt%7D%5E%7Bp%3D0%7D%7BI%28p%29%7D).

Let ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=y%28t%29%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+++%5Cmathscr%7BI%7D%28t%29+%5C%5C+D%28t%29+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D) be the vector including the real cumulative number of infective cases I (t), and the cumulative number of dead cases D(t) at day t. Let ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Chat%7By%7D%28t%29%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+++%5Chat%7B%5Cmathscr%7BI%7D%7D%28t%29+%5C%5C+%5Chat%7BD%7D%28t%29+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D) be the predicted counterpart of y(t) by our model at the same day. To find the optimal parameters vector which fits our model to the collected data y(t) over a time window ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5BT_0%2CT_1%5D) , authors have considered the following optimization problem over ![](https://www.zhihu.com/equation?tex=%5Cvarphi):

## Conclusion

When applied to Brazil’s cases, SEAIRD produced an excellent agreement to the data, with an R2 ≥ 90%. The probability of COVID-19 transmission was generally high (≥ 95%). On the basis of a 20-day modeling data, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was as low as 3 infected cases per 100,000 exposed persons in Brazil and France. Within the same time frame, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was the highest in France (16.4%) followed by Brazil (6.9%), and the lowest in Russia (≤ 1%). SEAIRD represents an asset for modeling infectious diseases in their dynamical stable phase, especially for new viruses when pathophysiology knowledge is very limited.
